# Monday's task No. 3
## Operating Systems

### Question 1
1. Starting the computer
1. Providing a user interface. 
Instead of using a terminal to access a program or a file on the computer, the operating system provides you a user-friendly interface that doesn’t require any knowledge in programming.
1. Help the computer to communicate with its peripherals and multitasking. Operating systems help computers with managing hundreds of processes that run at the same time.
1. Protect from malware and viruses.

### Question 2

I was surprised that computers in the 1940s and 1950s could run only one program at the time. There was no multitasking function available. 
I was also shocked that the process of interacting with a computer was very manual and complex. Because to print something, the programmer first needs to write a program on the punch card then give it to another person how would put this program into a computer, when it was available, and only after that you would get your result.

 
### Question 3

In 2003 most popular operating systems were WindowsXP(40%) and Windows2000(40%). Linux and macOS weren’t very popular at that time.
Since 2004 the number of computers using Windows2000 drastically dropped and  WindowsXP became an absolute dominant. And in January 2007 82% of computers were using WindowsXP. But then this number dropped as the new OS was released - Windows Vista. But it didn’t last long because the Windows 7 operating system was released and later became the most popular software. At the same time, macOS slowly but surely gained more and more popularity. 
In 2012 the Windows 8 was released it became more popular than mac and Linux OS but it was never able to reach the Windows 7 popularity. 
In 2015 the Windows 10 was released and in two years it became the most popular software.
And as data from 2019, Windows 10 in the most popular software with 58%, then goes Windows 7 16 %, macOS 10%, Linux 7 %, and Windows 8 6%.

## Programming task
```.py
# This program prints n amount of Fibonacci series

n = int(input("Enter to amount of numbers you want to print "))
fibonacci_new = 0
fibonacci1 = 0
fibonacci2 = 1

for i in range(n + 1):
    print(fibonacci1)
    fibonacci_new = fibonacci1 + fibonacci2
    fibonacci1 = fibonacci2
    fibonacci2 = fibonacci_new
